# About This Project
This project contains the exercise files for the entry level React17 course on Pluralsight. The demos directory contains original programs that have helped me master React17.

# Quickstart

cd demos
npm start

# Setting Up React Development Environment

npx create-react-app <application name>
npm start
```
